## Overview of the Citibike Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to add more visualizations via Tableau to the Citibike analysis in New York city that was created in Module 14. This analysis would be used to convince the potential investors who are interested in bike-sharing program in Des Moines.

## Results
- There are total of seven visualizations in the story. 
- The first visualization shows the breakdown of user types in New York city. There are two types of users: customers, who use either 24-hour pass or 3-day pass; and subscriber, who is an annual member. There were 1,900,359 subscribers and 443,865 customers, which is 81.07% and 18.93% of all users respectively. 
- The second visualization shows the gender breakdown of active users. There are 1,530,272 male users, which is 65.28% of all users, and 588,431 female users, which is 25.10% of all users. The gender of 225,521 users are unknown.
- The third visualization shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all users. According to the graph, 35,135 bikes were checked out for 1 minute. Most bikes were checked out for 5 minutes, at a count of 146,752. The number of bikes checked out decreased as checkout time increased. 
-The fourth visualization shows the length of time that bikes are checked out by gender. According to the graph, most males checked out bikes for 5 minutes, while most females checked out bikes for 6 minutes. Most riders with unknown gender checked out bikes for 11 minutes. 
-The fifth visualization shows the number of trips by weekday for each hour. According to the heatmap, there are high number of trips at 8 AM, 5 PM, 6 PM, and 7 PM every weekday. On the weekends, there are high number of trips between 9 AM and 7 PM.
-The sixth visualization shows the number of trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week. According to the heatmap, there are high number of trips at 8 AM, 5 PM, and 6 PM every weekday by both of male and female users. On the weekends, there are high amount number trips from 9 AM to 7 PM by all users. 
-The seventh visualization shows the number of trips for each day of the week by gender and user type. According to the graph, there are highest number of trips on Thursday by male subscribers and female subscribers. Also, subscribers ride more on weekdays compared to weekends. Unlike subscribers, customers ride more on weekends compared to weekdays.

## Summary
-According to the visualizations that were created, the number of male users are 2.6 times higher than the female users and the number of annual subscribers are about 4.6 times higher than customers who use 24-hour pass or 3-day pass. Most number of bikes were checked out for only shorter period of time like 5 to 11 minutes by all genders. Finally, subscribers ride more at 8 AM, 5 PM, and 6 PM on weekdays, which implies that many subscribers use Citi bikes for commuting to and from work. Unlike subscribers, customers who use 24-hour pass or 3-day pass use Citi bikes more on the weekend than weekdays. 
-For future analysis, I would suggest to add top starting locations and top ending locations maps from Module 14 and analyze more details on the most popular starting and ending bike stations to see travel patterns and if they are around offices.
